# Controlled Chaos Shifts (CCS)

![](https://github.com/ControlledChaosShifts/CCS/raw/main/images/rb_52815_500.png)

### What is CCS?

A novel approach that introduces controlled "chaos" into AI systems.

- Humans as strategic disruptors without gaming the systems or breaking rules
- Disruption and chaos as features, not bugs
- Uncertainty as a creative force, more short term strategy, less long term
- The human's role is to intentionally create productive chaos by briefly seizing AI control
- Not random disruption or simple handicapping, or one-sided rules
- Based on establishing a balanced minimal rule set rather than arbitrary intervention

### Why CCS is needed:

- To make games more interesting
- To balance interaction dynamics and prevent excessive dominance in systems involving AI
- To offer a new design principle for creating more adaptable, human-compatible AI

Berserker could address these concerns from the world's best champions:

- Frustration with memorization over creativity
- Concerns about engine-based preparation
- Loss of human elements in the game
- Reduced enjoyment in classical time controls

From the dawn of humanity, humans have feared domination - but never from anything resembling AI. CCS could help. Perhaps it's time to establish a new milestone in our AI journey—one where the fundamental design of AI systems takes pause. A White Star Line publicity brochure produced in 1910 for the twin ships Olympic and Titanic stated these two wonderful vessels were designed to be unsinkable. 'Wonderful technologies' must afford society "time to turn." When OpenAI's Q3 system recently scored 85% on the ARC-AGI benchmark, should we consider this breakthrough to be of an "unsinkable" design?
